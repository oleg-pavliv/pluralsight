* Bar charts
  Used to display categories
  
  Do:
    - Compare distict values
    - Use color to highlight a single (!) bar. Don't use different colors for every bar
  Dont:
    - Change Y axis to not start at zero (skewing data)
    - Create stacked bars: can be confusing

* Line chars

  Do: 
    - Comare values over time
    - Show trend lines
    - Year by year comparison: each line a separate year
  Dont:
    - Shrink X axis to show steeper growth (to distinguish flat lines)
    - Label every data point
 
  Focus on visual, add details later (tooltips, etc)

* Scatter plots

  Do:
    - disaggregate results to see individual points, patterns, etc
    - use distinct measurements (not obvious like duration/cost of project) e.g. size of project / profit
  Dont:
    - aggregate highly
    - use dozens of colors

* Chart types to avoid:
  - Pie (or any radial): difficult to compare angles
  - stacked
  - 3D
  - Decorative (noise)
