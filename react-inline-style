advantages:
- no naming: with CSS we need to invent names which soon become unintuitive (OuterTitle)
- easy refactoring: just cut and paste. With CSS we need to find a CSS styles and copy them as well
- easy inline editing: everything is just in place, no need to look for different classes in separate CSS files


CSS 7 problems (from Christopher Chedeau):
1. Global namespaces
2. Dependencies: how to specify only css you need
3. Dead code elimination
4. Minification: minimize class names
5. Sharing constants: comments "you have to keep this in sync with another CSS class, etc"
6. Non-deterministic resolution: if more than one rules can be applied
7. Isolation
